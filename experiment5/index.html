				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I had an idea I wanted to accomplished since attending section and it was to make an audio visualizer using the particles that you can see <a style = "color: black;" href = "https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1966464">here.</a></p>
				<p>Unfortunately, it was too much to integrate into my site as there were more components connected to this than I expected. I even considered making a program from scratch using some concepts as inspiration but I didn't know what would be allowed for this assignment.</p>
				<p>So I decided to switch inspirations to see what I can accomplish. I found this <a style = "color: black;" href = "https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1552167">source</a> to experiement with for this assignment.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>At first, I made sure that the program would fit into the canvas as I usually do with these experiments. I had some difficulty integrating my original idea for this assignment so I decided to switch my source inspiration as I mentioned earlier.</p>
				<p>Fitting the program into canvas wasn't too difficult with this inspiration and I was able to add my changes without any issue in terms of integrating into the site itself. However, I did struggle with implementing some of my ideas to the program code itself. However, I made compromises to make things work for my experiment.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I tried a lot of different things and one of them was going for a rainbow animation that I previously did for another experiment. However, due to how the program was setup, I wasn't able to get it to work properly so I just added color to the original monochrome look which creates a satifying effect.</p>
				<p>Afterwards, I wanted to incorporate some mouse interaction with the program but I wasn't sure exactly what I could implement. Eventually I made it so that instead of rotating automatically, you can adjust the rotation through the movement of the mouse. I enjoyed how it turned out and how you can make the cube spin.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I really enjoyed messing around with this program and adding my own changes to it. I wish I was able accomplish more with my program but the mistakes I made along the way was worth the effort and I fulfilled the goal of the assignment by experimenting with the program and learning from my failures.</p>
