				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>Originally I wanted to make an audio visualizer this week but I ended up being very overwhelmed so this is the result of what I was able to accomplish. So instead, I found this source that I wanted to play around with. I was always curious about the world and different data visualizations related to our planet. I got inspiration from this source <a style = "color: black;" href = "https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/tttPKxZi">here.</a></p>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After setting up the sketch inside the canvas, I played around with the settings such as the lighting and the strokes with all the objects printed. I wanted to see how I can adapt the code to make it my own and this was the result.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I am most proud of the left and right arrow key functionality. I felt like it was more immersive having interactivity and control over the planet spinning instead of having it spin automatically. I also liked how the boxes now look like little marshmellows instead of being dark little cubes when lighting was enabled.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall, I had fun messing around with the program and trying out the settings. I wish I had more time to experiment but this week has been very hectic for me so I tried my best with the time I had.</p>
