				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started this assignment by looking through examples of general design by using <a style = "color: black;" href = "http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/">this link</a> and I found an example I really liked.</p>
				<p>I ended up using <a style = "color: black;" href = "https://editor.p5js.org/generative-design/sketches/P_2_1_1_04">this code</a> and I had some problems implementing what I wanted to create.</p>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>Originally, I wanted to make a pinball-like game with having the rotating platforms guide and more a ball that is rolling down. This was my original vision for the project I wanted to create. However, due to the nature of how images worked with my project, I was unable to get the collision working with the images so I ended up scrapping my idea.</p>
				<p>Afterwards, I struggled with various concepts until I decided to make smaller goals instead of looking to the big picture. Sometimes it is difficult to want to make a huge comprehensive project in a little amount of time so I chose to make a couple gimmicks and see if the experience was entertaining or not.</p>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>The purpose of this experiment was to test how different components that didn't fit within the full picture, feel after being put together. As everything within this piece is disconnected from each other, it was an interesting experience that was different from what we are originally used to.</p>
				<p>First, I started with the base code of my original inspiration and I thought of ways of adding things to help diversify the experience. Things such as changing the background and adding particles to the game. I wasn't sure what exactly I wanted to accomplish due to my original failure of having a pinball game. Eventually I ended up making falling particles which looks like snow raining from the sky. I liked it and while it wasn't interactable by the rotating lines from the original, I thought it gave it a nice vibe. However, I didn't like the lack of interactivity to the falling snow so I gave it a function that allowed the user to click on them. Through trial and error, eventually I got it so that you can launch the balls a little bit before it suddenly falls super fast and constantly. This is a bug as I intended it to be more of a lighter launch but I kept it in because I thought it was neat. Also the background changes colors and originally it could potentially give people seizures from epilepsy with how rapidly the colors changed. Luckily I gave it more of a delay and helped it transition at a slower speed. It seems nice now and it isn't too intrusive for the overall experience.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall, it was a fun experiment with working on different components that are made to not be functionally interactable with each other while still attempting to make some cohesion for an expereince. I achieved this through the trial and errors that I experienced and I think it went well. I struggled a lot throughout this project but I believe I got a lot out of it as well.</p>
