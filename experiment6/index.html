				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I attended section and I got inspired by one of the examples that was shown <a style = "color: black;" href = "https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1983391">here.</a></p>
				<p>As the text circled around a cylinder, it reminded me of a easter egg (secret) from a game that I enjoyed a lot. You can find a video of the secret <a style = "color: black;" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSc2BFu0t4Y&t=139s">here.</a></p>
				<p>I wanted to replicate this event into my p5.js code and due to how I saw the code that inspired me implement their text scrolling, I decided this is what I would do for this assignment.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After fitting the content into the canvas container, I proceeded to work on adding variables and changing the functionality of the code.</p>
				<p>One problem I had with integrating is with learning the sound library reference of p5.js and this will be helpful for working on audio visualizers for my group project.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>After I succeeded integrating the code into my website, I decided to do a number of things to change the original code. One of them is noticing that the original code had commented out the method of orbitControl(); which allows you to rotate around the cylinder and even zoom in and out on it. This provided a lot of functionality to allow for different perspectives on viewing the text which added a lot to my overall usage of this experiment.</p>
				<p>After, I changed the words listed to reference my inspirational video from the video game I liked and changed it to reflect myself as the author. Then, I made both the color of the text and background change color in a rainbow color range and added speed variables that can change how quickly the color changes over time.</p>
				<p>Then, I added a variable to change the text speed and added music from the video game I liked to complete the reference.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall, I am happy with how things turned out. If you are reading this though, here's a warning.</p> <p style="font-weight: bold;">A SOUND WARNING.</p>
				<p style="font-style: italic;">The music may be very loud so I recommend turning down the volume for headphone users.</p>
				<p>One problem I had though is that when increasing the speed, it causes more lag which makes some functionality not work. Since there is many components going on, it can make it easy for p5.js to lag out and not function properly which is something I had to watch out for.</p>
				<p>Now for the controls. In order to actually view the text properly, you'll need to hold down the mouse click button. Then you can either scroll in and out by swiping appropiately but it only changes when you are holding down mouse button. Then you can click and drag to change the rotation.</p>
				<p>Please enjoy and have fun!</p>
