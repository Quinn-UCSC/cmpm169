				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started this assignment by looking through examples of general design by using <a style = "color: black;" href = "http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/">this link</a> and I found an example I really liked.</p>
				<p>Originally I ended up finding <a style = "color: black;" href = "https://editor.p5js.org/generative-design/sketches/M_1_5_02">this example</a> to edit and I made <a style = "color: black;" href = "https://editor.p5js.org/quinngamedevelopment/sketches/hwu6BPCV3">this.</a></p>
				<p>Unfortunately I was not able to add said program to my site so I opted to using <a style = "color: black;" href = "http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?02_M/M_1_4_01">this example</a> as the base of my project.</p>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>Originally I attempted integrating the stroke lines animation but despite implementing the agent script and the other references the program used, I couldn't get the program functional on my website.</p>
				<p>Now, I ended up working with this nice noise terrain and I thought of some ideas on what I can do with it. You can rotate it using right click and changing the "vibrations" using left click. It was then that I thought of the concept of a visualizer that you'd see in music videos.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I got inspired to make it into a visualizer and what I did first was rotate it upside down and setup it into canvas.</p>
				<p>Afterwards, I decided to give it a rainbow animation that's constantly looping and finally made it into the shape of a ring. This helped give off the visualizer feeling while also making it rotatable to change the perspective on what it looks like.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I was able to accomplish what I wanted to achieve. While I would need to add sound and make it change based off sound waves in order to make it into an actual visualizer, I believe this achieved what I wanted to do within the scope of this project. Plus, I am potentially planning to make some visualizers for the group project so I may revisit this code then!</p>
