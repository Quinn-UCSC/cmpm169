				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>From the section I attended, I was able to come up with the idea I wanted to try out for this assignment. An example of a program that used symbols for the pixels of the camera interested me and you can see this project <a style = "color: black;" href = "https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/nFOs57gVh">here.</a></p>
				<p>I wanted to change the colors originally from greyscale to something that reflects the tones of the image using color.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>There weren't much problems with integerating my program to my website and I used the template given for fitting the camera into the canvas.</p>
				<p>While I eventually got it working pretty quickly, I did have some small mistake I made when adding it which is by leaving the WEBGL inside the arguement, it made the sizing of the canvas glitch out. I was confused why that occurred until I debugged and found out it was due to the WEBGL part.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>For what I changed from the code, I opted to having different hue options for the user to choose from. This can change how the image is shown and I think it turned out well. I found that some colors turned out too deep so I made them less saturated to make sure that it's easier on the eyes.</p>
				<p>I am happy to test out user input using key commands for this project and I hope you enjoy what I made!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I achieved what I wanted to! I feel that I learned about cameras in this assignment and I enjoyed playing around with the different colors and tones to make different outcomes occur.</p>
